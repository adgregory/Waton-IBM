# Welcome to Kairos! 
--------------------------------
A platform that introduces a new way to provide a safe system that allows you to access the most recurrent places in your daily routine, such as supermarkets, restaurants, so on. Also, for administrators, gives the ability to manage their establishment regarding the flow of people based on an automated and intelligent method that will give them control over this crisis. 

Therefore, Kairos allows users to know in advance the number of people that will be in an establishment, helping both the user to safely go out, and the admin to have safe control over their business.

# Kairos Complete Description

## Problem
The Covid-19 pandemic has spread around the world not only a virus, but as a global economic crisis. The virus transmission coefficient is high (1 person can infect other 40), which has caused many establishments such as shops, restaurants and sports facilities, to close or face strict regulations in order to keep social distancing when operating. In total, the economic effect of the pandemic has brought a 3.5% increase in global unemployment with respect to 2019 (IMF). In Colombia the unemployment rate increased to 21.4% One of the main factors is found on the restrictions on in person transactions (restaurants, stores and so on). Developing countries like Colombia cannot keep the economic at a standstill, for the social consequences are made more critical by the limited aid that government is able to provide. In face of this restrictions, owners had to close their business and fire employees because of the losses. Because of the lack of strategies of safely not only open establishments, but also re-activate economy, we created Kairos, an intelligent crowd-managing platform to decrease establishments closing rate.

## Solution
We built a mobile app that lets the user make reservations, know the capacity of the store at a specific time, and predicts the people that will be in that establishment at that hour. This makes for a safer, more efficient visit. Being a two-front platform, the owner (admin) will also benefit from this, having a better sense of the potential visits during and after the lockdown, which not only optimizes the flow of people and hence the labor costs, but also protects the health of their visitants.

In order to train the Machine Learning model we took into count 9 different variables that directly affects people’s mobility, and the one that will be tuned which is the maximum number of people that a place can hold, according to social distancing regulations and its area.  All these variables together show a better, but not still exact, way to know the amount of people presented in a store.

## Kairos vs Existent Solutions
We expect to automate the entrance and preserve biosecurity in establishments in order to safely open and reduce people’s contact. Currently, the only direct existent solution is the typical online reservation which is socially sustainable for pre-pandemic usage; which purpose is to have an order depending upon the number of individuals that can arrive in different hours to a specific establishment, without any further intension of managing booking efficiency in pro of the optimum capacity for users. Our motivation is focused on an intelligent solution that transforms that service into a useful tool that preserves biosecurity among our users and administrators.

## IBM Support
Achieving this by being able to work with IBM in order to not only enhance the capabilities of our platform by introducing automated temperature measurement, but also improve the implemented technology and accessibility to users and establishments.

## Conclusion
Isaac Asimov states in his book I, robot the three laws of robotics, which have gained relevance with the recent boom of artificial intelligence (AI). Whether automation can harm humans, is arguably crucial for all possible applications. Indeed, Machine Learning has a real path forward in creating actionable insights, if we focus on making technology that makes humans better, rather than making humans better at understanding prepackaged technology.
